This paper proposes a novel path-finding algorithm for wide-area, image-guided navigation. In the Wide Area Visual Navigation (WAVN) approach, a robot-centric blockchain consensus mechanism is used to share visual information.  We develop a novel navigation algorithm for WAVN, Randomly Shortened Chain (RSC), which has linear computational complexity, and also a robust version that can handle landmark visibility loss (RRSC). 
We present numerical simulation results comparing RSC with the existing graph-based approach and an RRT* approach for WAVN planning. Both RSC and RRT* are significantly faster than the graph-based approach but at the cost of longer paths, measured in the number of common landmarks.  RSC improves on RRT* in both average path length and computation time because it leverages the WAVN ledger information. When the robust versions of RSC and the graph-based approach are compared, RRSC shows a $72\%$ improvement in reaching a target despite visibility failures during path execution while preserving its computational advantage - an essential plus for real-world environments.
